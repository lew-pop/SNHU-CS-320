# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Specifications and requirements are essential for interpreting user needs. In project development, there will be a product backlog containing requirements and specifications derived from user stories. The product backlog is managed and optimized by the product owner. It is important to understand who a requirement is for and how it helps that particular user. The requirements should clearly state the user, clause, task, and desired goal. It’s best to try and limit bias when incorporating user needs into a program unless otherwise discussed with the product owner and other stakeholders.   


# How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software similar to solving a math problem. I write down all the knowns and try to compile a list of the unknowns. I create a skeleton outline for any classes, functions, or variables the software will need. If the software is significant with many components, I will create empty folders in a repository to visualize the system’s structure and get an idea of how it will work.


# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Testing plays a significant role in ensuring a program is secure and functional. Utilizing coverage tests is a great way to ensure the effectiveness of the test and functionality of a program. The Singlton-design pattern is another great concept to ensure programs are secure. Singleton design patterns ensure that only one instance of the code is running at once and that duplicate instances or user IDs are not generated.
